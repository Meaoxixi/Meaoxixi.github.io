# Meao's Blog 
进一步有一步的欢喜。

## Yoo, I'm Xi Wang | 王茜 👋

Thia is my personal blog where I document my learning, work, and life. Here, I share experiences and insights in fields like computer vision, image generation, and codeing. Feel free to visit and engage with me!

I'm a first-year Master's student in the [Interdisciplinary Intelligent Graphics Group (IIGG)](https://yang-group.github.io/#/) at Jilin University, happily guided by the  Associate Professor [Xi Yang](https://keepthinkingyx.github.io/Xi-Yang/).

🖋I graduated from Jilin University in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. My research interests focus on the computer vision and image processing. Right now, I'm working on image generation tasks with diffusion models. If you're also interested in this exciting work and looking for any kind of academic collaboration, let's team up and become research buddies! You're welcome to get in touch with me at `qianwang23@mails.jlu.edu.cn` 🍻 .

    <p>We propose FilterPrompt, an approach to enhance the model control effect. It can be universally applied to any diffusion model, allowing users to adjust the representation of specific image features in accordance with task requirements, thereby facilitating more precise and controllable generation outcomes.</p>
